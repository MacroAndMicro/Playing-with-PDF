# Playing-with-PDF

PDFs have already made our ives a lot easier. 

Through the codes, i have attempted to make it a smoother by adding multiple functionalities to the PDF files using PYthon coding.

In PDF_2_CSV, the code converts a PDF file to a CSV file. This way it can be used in MS Excel, which we all know is a very powerfull tool. 

In PDF_Audiobook, the system reads out the uploaded PDF file, from the oage that you want.

In PDF_Merger, we merge two PDFs to make a single PDF.
